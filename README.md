# Four_In_Row

This is a **simple implementation of the Four In a Row game, developed during high school using basic concepts of C**.

## How to play

The game is a two player game, where each player has to connect four pieces of the same color in a row, column or diagonal.

At first, you will be prompted to insert the players' names, and each player will be assigned a symbol (X or O).

For each turn the play board will be displayed, and the player will be prompted to insert the column where he wants to place his piece.

The game will end when one of the players connects four pieces in a row, column or diagonal, or when the board is full.

## How to compile

To compile the game, you need to have the GCC compiler installed on your machine.

To compile the game, simply run the following command:

```bash
gcc -o Main Main.c
```

## How to run

To run the game, simply run the following command:

```bash
./Main
```

## Improvements / pull requests

Since I haven't touched this code in a long time (from about 2017), **I would love to see improvements**, so feel free to fork this repository and make pull requests.

Have a nice coding day,
